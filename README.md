# Consuming Web Service with Spring Boot

This project is an example of how to consume a RESTful web service using Spring Boot and the RestTemplate.

# Usage

Clone the repository
Open the project in an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
Run the project by running the Week11ConsumingWebServiceApplication class
Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your web browser to view a list of students retrieved from the server-side web service

# The StudentController and Student classes
The StudentController and Student classes can be used in conjunction with the RESTful services project provided earlier by creating a RESTful web service for managing Student objects on the server-side, and then consuming that web service in a client application using the RestTemplate in the StudentController class.

On the server-side, you would create a RESTful web service for managing Student objects by creating a StudentController class (similar to the one provided), and defining appropriate RESTful endpoints to handle CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on Student objects. This would involve using annotations such as @GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, and @DeleteMapping, to map HTTP requests to appropriate controller methods.

Once you have deployed your RESTful web service to a web server, you can use the RestTemplate in the StudentController class to consume the web service from a client application. The RestTemplate allows you to make HTTP requests to the RESTful endpoints defined in the StudentController class, and deserialize the responses into Student objects. In the viewStudents method, for example, the RestTemplate is used to make a GET request to the /students endpoint on the server, and deserialize the response into an array of Student objects. These objects are then added to the model, and rendered by the view.html template.

Overall, the StudentController and Student classes provide an example of how to consume a RESTful web service from a client application using Spring Boot and the RestTemplate.
